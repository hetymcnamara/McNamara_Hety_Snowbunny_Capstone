 ## Introduction

 I recently visited my first ski resort and learned how to ski! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it as it was less intimidating than I had orginally thought.  I'd like to help more people explore the world of winter resorts - that's how Snow Bunny was born!

# Process

## Plan

I used this sketch as a jumping off point. The priority was a clean and easy to navigate app.

 ## Build

### 1. User Authentication

I started  with user authentication - this took the most time to figure out and it proved to be very buggy. There are two routes: LogIn and Register

### 2. API

Next I created a data file to filter and supply more information to the Ski and resort coniditons API I used from RapidAPI.

### 3. Back-end

* Set up server - ensuring successful connection with MongoDB
  * Entry point for backend is src/index.js
    
* Set up Schemas - (1) User (2) Resorts (3) Resorts Data 

* Set up Routes - (1) User (2) Mountain (3) Resort Data

### 4. Front-end

* Entry point is src/App.js
  
* Components and Pages:
  * Auth.js page has Log in and Register components inside.
  * Home.js is the index page
  * Dashboard.jsx is the showcase page

### Technology Used
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* NodeJs
* JavaScript
* Axios
* Pico.css
* RapidAPI
* VS code
* Netlify - frontend deployment
* Render - backend deployment
